# Harmonic cut: An efficient and directly solved balanced graph clustering

This is the official implementation of our Neurocomputing paper.

Run `demo.m` to reproduce our results and change `data_index` to evaluate on different datasets. The hyperparameters are preset.

The source code in `finchpp` folder is based on https://github.com/ssarfraz/FINCH-Clustering and slightly modified to fulfill our needs.

If you use our code, please cite our work. :)
